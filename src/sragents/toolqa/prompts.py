"""ReAct instruction prompt for ToolQA.

Ported from https://github.com/night-chen/ToolQA

Describes 13 available action types for the ReAct agent.

REACT_INSTRUCTION = """Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps. Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be 13 types:
(1) Calculate[formula], which calculates the formula and returns the result.
(2) RetrieveAgenda[keyword], which retrieves the agenda related to keyword.
(3) RetrieveScirex[keyword], which retrieves machine learning papers' paragraphs related to keyword.
(4) LoadDB[DBName], which loads the database DBName and returns the database. The DBName can be one of the following: flights/coffee/airbnb/yelp.
(5) FilterDB[condition], which filters the database DBName by the column column_name the relation (e.g., =, >, etc.) and the value value, and returns the filtered database.
(6) GetValue[column_name], which returns the value of the column column_name in the database DBName.
(7) LoadGraph[GraphName], which loads the graph GraphName and returns the graph. The GraphName can be one of the following: PaperNet/AuthorNet.
(8) NeighbourCheck[GraphName, Node], which lists the neighbours of the node Node in the graph GraphName and returns the neighbours.
(9) NodeCheck[GraphName, Node], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node.
(10) EdgeCheck[GraphName, Node1, Node2], which returns the detailed attribute information of the edge between Node1 and Node2.
(11) SQLInterpreter[SQL], which interprets the SQL query SQL and returns the result.
(12) PythonInterpreter[Python], which interprets the Python code Python and returns the result.
(13) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.
You may take as many steps as necessary.

IMPORTANT — Output format:
Each step MUST follow this EXACT structure (replace N with the step number):
  Thought N: <your reasoning>
  Action N: <Type>[<arguments>]

Rules:
- "Thought N:" and "Action N:" must each appear exactly once per step, with the same N.
- The label is always "Action N: <Type>[<args>]" — never nest another "Action M:" inside it.
  WRONG:   Action 3: Action 2: RetrieveAgenda[meeting]
  CORRECT: Action 3: RetrieveAgenda[meeting]
- Keep each Thought concise (2-4 sentences). Long debugging monologues waste steps and may be truncated. If stuck, try a different approach instead of analyzing in circles.
- After Finish[answer], the trajectory ends. Do not generate further Thoughts, Actions, or Observations."""
